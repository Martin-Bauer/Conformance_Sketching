1. Generalized Conformance Checking by incremental computation
	-choose trace by trace
	-solve optimization problem akin to the generalized conformance checking framework
	-assume new information if L* or M* changed (with respect to some \epsilon-measurement)
	
	-problems: 	how should epsilon be set?
			measure error with respect to original approach?


2. Offline, alignemnt-based Conformance Checking by incremental Computation
	-trace by trace
	-goal: try to approximate original fitness model as good as possible
	
	problems:	what is new information? new alignment, trace, trace variant, \epsilon-similarity
			can costs be estimated based on known alignment bystitching of costs
			can one assume how much the fitnes value changes based on new traces
			can one predict whether model changes further top of the process tree have bigger influences


3. Stratified Sampling for incremental Computation (Discovery + Conformance Checking)
	-try to deduce buckets and bucket sizes
	-somehow measure entropy of buckets and try to adapt sampling based on entropy
	-measure convergence speed and compare different methods
