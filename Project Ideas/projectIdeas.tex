\section{Generalized Conformance Checking by incremental Computation}
\subsection{Goal}
Find Log $L^* \subseteq L$ and Model $M^*$ that is similar to $M$\\
Does this approach yield similar results?


\subsection{Related Work}
$https://www.matthiasweidlich.com/paper/log_model_trust_BPM_2016.pdf$
\subsection{Approach}
-choose trace by trace from Log L\\
-mine model from new Sublog and check for tree-edit distance in newly mined Model\\
-if tree-edit distance is in trust-based proximity to model stop\\
-this gives $L^*$ and $M^*$\\

\subsection{Problems}
-does this approach guarantee, that $L^*$ and $M^*$ both are in trust-based proximity?

\section{Offline, alignemnt-based Conformance Checking by incremental Computation}
\subsection{Goal}
Try to approximate the correct fitness value for M and L by incremental approximation.

\subsection{Approach}
-choose trace by trace\\
-calculate alignment for trace and throug this the cost of trace\\
-save the alignment and the cost of it\\
-use already seen alignments to deduct costs of concatenations of already seen traces\\
-take average of costs and check how much it changes - maybe stop when change in average is below an $\epsilon$

\subsection{Problems}
-should alignment costs just be added upon each other
-can one approximate how big the difference in alignment costs changes, based on the relative position of the difference? i.e. earlier differentiations cost more than later ones
-how to stitch together two already seen alignments, just add up? check for path in alignment from one to the other
-what is new information?

\section{Stratified Sampling for incremental Computation (Discovery + Conformance Checking)}
\subsection{Goal}
Deduce more efficient sampling of traces

\subsection{Approach}
-partition Log into buckets and sample from buckets that have higher entropy\\

\subsection{Approach}
How can one efficiently deduct a good Bucket size?\\
How should entropy be measured?
